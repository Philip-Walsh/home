        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
        My name is Philip Walsh. I am Currently in Cork City, Where I study Applied Computer Technologies at UCC.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have always been a creative thinker and I developed a passion for multimedia, web development and coding while I was studying for my Bachelor in <i>Marine Science</i> at University. Now that I am studying in the computer science field my knowledge base in programming is growing and developing. I intend to pursue a Masters in <i>Computer Science</i> but meanwhile I am busy developing programs, graphics and sites that reflect my course work, self-taught skills and diverse work
          history.</p>
        <p>
        If you wish to know more about my journey through the ever changing landscape of web development, you can contact me. If you canâ€™t reach me immediately I am probably in the great outdoors kayaking on one of our many <em>wonderful Irish waterways</em> but I will get back to you <b>ASAP</b>.
